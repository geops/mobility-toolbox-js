## Install

Install the library and the peer dependencies:

```bash
yarn add ol maplibre-gl mobility-toolbox-js
```

## Development

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

`yarn dev` starts a vite server using the `index.html` file at the root of the project.
This html file loads the `dev.js` file. Use this file to develop the library.
Each time you modifiy the library code you have to run `yarn build:tsc` to see the changes.

## Development documentation

The documentations website is located in the `doc/`  folder.
It's a nextJS website that use the mobility-toolbox-js library built from the `build/` folder.

## Deploy

This library website is deployed automatically using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/geops).
For Vercel we have to add the nextjs and raw-loader modules in the dev dependencies of the main package.json.
But those 2 librairies are not needed to build the library.
